# libft
My work for 42 School, Contains a library designed for the work later assigned in the cursus.


ft_substr allocates to0 much memory in some cases, find a way to fix that if you can,
i have, but, now it segfaults when len is specified as 0 and start is specified as a very large number

ft_memmove crashes on one test (on my m1 macbook (not on the school mac) using francinette as a tester), 
still passes moulinette

ft_strrchr crashes on one test using francinette, again it didnt at school
still passes moulinette, even without c typecast as a char


... TBC
